# Crop Analysis with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to analyze crop data and visualize results using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and a confusion matrix heatmap for model evaluation.

# Project Objective 

The primary goal appears to be crop classification—predicting which crop is best suited to specific environmental and soil conditions—or model evaluation to understand prediction accuracy. This could be useful for farmers or agricultural researchers to optimize crop selection.

## Project Structure
- `content/` - Contains the dataset (`data.csv`).
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebook with the analysis (`Crop.ipynb`).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suku-10/Crop-Prediction.git
   cd Crop-Prediction

2. Create Virtual Enviornment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    myenv\scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash 
    jupyter notebook Crop.ipynb

## Dataset :- 
The dataset (data.csv) contains features like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and crop labels.
